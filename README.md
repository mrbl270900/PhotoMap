# PhotoMap
This is a project developed by five students from University of Roskilde. 
This project is an app called "Photomap". 
In the app it is possible to upload a photo to the app, and based on the location data embedded in the photo, the app can place the the photo on the map. 
You can run the app be using the Android Emulater in the Android Studios SDK. The guide can be found on this website: https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator
Due to the use of different API's in this project you will have to use the the Android Studios Android Emulater to run the app by using the apk from this project, which can be found here: https://github.com/mrbl270900/PhotoMap/tree/master/app/build/outputs/apk/debug

REMINDER: Photos from platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc. will usually have no location data, so photos either copied or downloaded from social media sites, won't automatically be placed on the map.
